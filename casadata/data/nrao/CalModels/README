These are all un-reconvolved images of AIPS CC lists, properly scaled
to the Perley-Taylor 1999 flux density for the frequencies at which 
they were observed.

NB: It is not necessary for these images to have the correct scale.
CASA will rescale as needed to the correct scale as a function
of frequency according to the flux density standard specified
by the user in setjy (09Feb18 gmoellen)

NB: The recipe for creating these images in AIPS (09Feb18) is
as follows:

1. Use CALRD (or other means) to import the desired image file
   (Usually this is an AIPS image restored to an appropriate
    resolution and containing a CC table with the clean component
    model; for f.d.-scaling purposes, AIPS uses only the CC model.)

2. Use COMB with the image from above specifed in both inn and in2n,
   OPCODE='SUM', APARM=1,-1,0 (to effect subtraction), and BLC/TRC set
   to select an appropriate section of the image such that the output
   will have 2^n pixels on a side (as required by RSTOR below).  Don't
   forget to give the output a useful name.

3. Run RSTOR with the output of COMB in inn, the original image in in2n,
   and a sensible output name.  Use BMAJ=1e-8; BMIN=1e-8 to yield
   an image which is effectively unrestored. 

4. Export the result of RSTOR with FITTP, and import into CASA with
   importfits.  The CASA image that results can be specified in
   setjy.

UPDATE 2009/10/08: The bandwidth (cdelt3) has been changed to be 2 GHz
in these images so WIDAR data will not run into trouble using older
versions of setjy which blank MODEL_DATA outside this range.
