From Tony Remijan (CAS-900)

The RRF line list contains all the transitions of all the known astronomical molecules where we have recommended a freq for.
The column labels for the RRF is: 
Chemical Formula; Chemical Name; Rest Freq in MHz; Transition QNs; Line Strength (Sijmu^2); Lower State Energy (K);
Catalog Name where the data came from

The Lovas_NIST list is an update to the Lovas recommended freq list from NIST. These data are all the known detected
transitions... These data will only be available in Splatalogue from now on. In this case, the column labels for the
Lovas_NIST file is:
Chemical Formula; Chemical Name; Rest Freq in MHz; Transition QNs; detected astronomical intensity.

Frank Lovas did not keep track of consistent intensity units so there are some in mK, K, Jy, Jy/beam etc...however,
if we are just "frequency flagging", that is not a problem.
