API
====================

The casaconfig module includes a default configuration file (*config.py*) used for controlling the execution of a `CASA <https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
session, as well as a set of functions for accessing and manipulating the external data needed by CASA.

The interface for these two components is specified herein.
