def update_all(path=None, logger=None):
    """
    Update the data contants at path to the most recently released versions
    of casarundata and measures data. 

    If path does not exist it will be created (the user must have permission
    to create path).

    If path does exist and is not empty it must contain a previously
    installed version of casarundata. Path must be a directory and it
    must be owned by the user.

    If path is not provided then config is imported and the measurespath value set
    by that process will be used.

    If path already contains the most recent versions of casarundata and 
    measurespath then nothing will change at path.

    This uses pull_data, data_update and measures_update. See the
    documentation for those functions for additional details.

    Some of the data updated by this function is only read when casatools starts.
    Use of update_all after CASA has started should typically be followed by a restart 
    so that any changes are seen by the tools and tasks that use this data.

    Parameters
       - path (str=None) - Folder path to place casarundata contents. It must not exist, or be empty, or contain a valid, previously installed version. If it exists, it must be owned by the user. Default None uses the value of measurespath set by importing config.py.
       - logger (casatools.logsink=None) - Instance of the casalogger to use for writing messages. Messages are always written to the terminal. Default None does not write any messages to a logger.

    Returns
       None
