def get_data_info(path=None, logger=None):
    """
    Get the summary information on the 3 types of data managed by casaconfig.

    The return value is a dictionary by type of of data : 'casarundata', 'measures',
    and 'release'.

    The path is the location to use to search for the installed release information.
    The path argument defaults to config.measurespath when not set.

    For each type the value is a dictionary of 'version' and 'date' where
    version is the version string and date is the date when it was installed.
    These values are taken from the readme.txt file for each type.

    The 'release' type is from the release_data_readme.txt file which is copied
    into place when a modular CASA is built. It is the release.txt for the
    data appropriate for that module CASA release and it used by the "--reference-testing"
    command line option for casaconfig. That allows casaconfig to install that
    casarundata version for testing purposes. The release information comes from the
    casaconfig module and does not depend on the path argument.

    If path is empty or does not exist then the return value for the 'casarundata' and
    'measures' types is None.

    If no readme.txt file can be found at path but the contents of path have the directories
    expected for casarundata then the version returned for 'casarundata' is 'unknown' and
    the date is an empty string. The path location may contain casarundata from a legacy
    installation of CASA data. CASA may be able to use the files at this location but they
    can not be maintained by casaconfig.

    If no readme.txt file can be found for the measures at path/geodetic but both the geodetic
    and ephemeris directories are present in path then the version returned for 'measures' is
    'unknown' and the date is an empty string. The path location may contain measures data from
    a legacy installation of CASA data. CASA may be able to use any measures tables at this
    location by they may not be maintained by casaconfig.

    If 'release_data_readme.txt' file is not found with the casaconfig module the returned
    value for 'release' is None and the "--reference-testing" option will not do anything
    for this installation of casaconfig. This will be the case for a modular installation.

    If path has not been set (has a value of None) then the returned value will be None. This
    likely means that a casasiteconfig.py exists but has not yet been edited to set measurespath.

    Parameters
       - path (str) - Folder path to find the casarundata and measures data information. If not set then config.measurespath is used.
       - logger (casatools.logsink=None) - Instance of the casalogger to use for writing messages. Default None writes messages to the the terminal.
    
    Returns
       dict - a dictionary by type, 'casarundata', 'measures', 'release' where each type is a dictionary 'version', 'date'. A return value of None indicates path is unset. A value of None for that type means no information could be found about that type.
