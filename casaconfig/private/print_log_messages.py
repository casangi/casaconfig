def print_log_messages(msg, logger, is_err=False, verbose=2):
    """
    Print msg and optionally write it to an instance of the casalogger.

    If msg is a list then the elements are each printed first followed by logging each element.

    Messages are normally printed to sys.stdout and logged as INFO to the casalogger.
    
    When is_err is True the message is printed sys.stderr and logged as SEVERE

    When verbose is < 2 then the message is not printed unless there is no logger

    This function is intended for internal casaconfig use.

    Parameters
       msg (str): The message to print and optionally log.
       logger (casatools.logsink): Instance of the casalogger to use. Not used if None.
       is_err (bool=False): When False, output goes to sys.stdout and logged as INFO level. When True, output goes to sys.stderr and logged as SEVERE
       verbose (int=2): When < 2 then msg is only printed if there is no logger, otherwise it's just logged

    Returns
       None
