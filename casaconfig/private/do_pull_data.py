def do_pull_data(path, version, installed_files, logger):
    """
    Pull the casarundata for the given version and install it in path, removing
    the isntalled files and updating the readme.txt file when done.

    This function is used by both pull_data and data_update when each has
    determind that the desired version should be installed. The calling function
    has already obtained the lock. No additional checking happens here. The
    calling function has already examined any existing readme file and used that
    to set the installed_files list as appropriate. 

    Parameters
       - path (str) - Folder path to place casadata contents.
       - version (str) - casadata version to retrieve.
       - installed_files (str list) - list of installed files from the version already installed. Set to an empty list if there is no previously installed version.
       - logger (casatools.logsink) - Instance of the casalogger to use for writing messages. Messages are always written to the terminal. Set to None to skip writing messages to a logger.

    Returns
       None
